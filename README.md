# Archery Mania!
This is a fun game made with the `pygame` Python module in which you have to shoot colorful targets to get 5 points each time you hit them. Be careful though - hitting the black ones will end the game!

# How To Run

In a terminal, run `cd Archery-Mania` to get to the project folder, then run `python3 main.py` if you have Python 3.
